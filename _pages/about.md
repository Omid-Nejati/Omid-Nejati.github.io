I am a research assistant at the Computer Vision Center at the Iran University of Science & Technology. I graduated with a master's degree in Electrical Engineering in 2022, which was being conducted under the supervision of Prof. Shahriar Baradaran Shokouhi. My long-term research goal is to enable AI agents to explain phenomena beyond low-level statistics of observable data.
